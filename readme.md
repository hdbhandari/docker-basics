# Introduction

- This repo supposed to contain my docker learning, just like other \*-basics series
- For now only 2 folders I have(not even sure when I created these on my system), which I am adding.
- Will try to create everything from scratch, with better comments in future

## More

- The repo under Java/vscode-remote-try-java is downloaded from [Microsoft Github Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-try-java)
